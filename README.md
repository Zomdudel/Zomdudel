I'm @Zomdudel.
I live in Germany near Osnabrueck.
I'm still going to school and on my way to get my 'Abitur' (german high-school diploma).
I’m interested in developing websites and an head-tracking app that uses the camera from my phone and sends the data to my computer.
I’m currently learning my first ever programming language, javascript.

I'd love to meet a lot some
